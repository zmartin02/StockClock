Ran this on Node.JS, so you will need that downloaded. You will also need to download puppeteer for Node.JS. To run this program, just put it into an IDE like 
VSCode and have it run continuously for how long as desired.  You can change how long you can run it for by going to line 77 and changing the time in milliseconds (you 
can look up time conversion for milliseconds, for example 10 minutes is 600000 milliseconds) You will also need to put you email and password into the fields (line 23 and 24, 
also again on line 30 and 31) In this program, it is continously checking the price of microsoft stock. To change this, just input what stock you want to track on line 11 and 14.
You will get continuous email updates based on the threshold you input, for example I have mine set at 0.5% change (either up or down), if you want to change this, go to line 45.
